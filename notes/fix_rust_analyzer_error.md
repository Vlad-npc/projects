# Fixing Rust Analyzer Error for Non-Root `Cargo.toml` in VS Code

If your `Cargo.toml` file is not located in the root directory of your workspace, Rust Analyzer may fail to fetch the workspace or provide proper code intelligence. This can result in errors like:

```
ERROR FetchWorkspaceError: rust-analyzer failed to fetch workspace
Request textDocument/formatting failed.
Message: Failed to spawn "rustfmt"
Code: -32603
```

To resolve this, you need to manually link your `Cargo.toml` file in your VS Code configuration.

## Steps to Resolve the Issue

### 1. Open `settings.json` in VS Code
- Press `Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,` to open settings.
- Search for `settings.json` in the search bar.
- Open the file to edit it directly.

### 2. Add the Path to Your `Cargo.toml`
Add the following configuration to the `settings.json` file, replacing the path with the correct relative path to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```json
"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
    "/mnt/c/GitProjects/learn-rust/projects/guessing_game/Cargo.toml"
]
```

### 3. Save and Restart VS Code
- Save the changes to `settings.json`.
- Close and reopen VS Code to ensure the new configuration is applied.

### 4. For Multiple Projects
If you have multiple Rust projects, you can link all their `Cargo.toml` files by adding them to the `linkedProjects` array:

```json
"rust-analyzer.linkedProjects": [
    "/mnt/c/GitProjects/learn-rust/projects/guessing_game/Cargo.toml",
    "/mnt/c/GitProjects/learn-rust/projects/another_project/Cargo.toml"
]
```

### 5. Verify the Setup
- Open the Rust file you want to work on.
- Check for Rust Analyzer errors. If everything is set up correctly, the errors should disappear, and features like formatting, auto-completion, and diagnostics should work.

## Explanation
Rust Analyzer relies on the presence of a `Cargo.toml` file to locate and understand the structure of your Rust project. By default, it assumes that `Cargo.toml` is in the root directory of your workspace. If it's not, you need to manually specify its location using the `rust-analyzer.linkedProjects` setting.
