# Learn Rust

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing and mastering the Rust programming language through exercises, small projects, and experiments.

## Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Rust programming.
- Explore Rust’s features like memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
- Practice writing idiomatic and efficient Rust code.
- Work on small projects to reinforce concepts and skills.

## Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

- **exercises/**: Contains small coding exercises to practice Rust syntax and concepts.
- **projects/**: Includes mini-projects to apply Rust in practical scenarios.
- **notes/**: Personal notes and documentation for Rust topics.

## Resources
Here are some resources I’m using to learn Rust:
- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)
- [Official Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
